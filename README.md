Animal State Prediction for Unbalanced dataset using appropriate visualization, Upsampling and Random Forest Classifier.

The Animal Welfare Center (AWC) is one of the oldest animal shelters in the United States that provide care and shelter to over 15,000 animals each year. To boost its effort to help and care for animals in need, the organization makes available its 
accumulated data and statistics as part of its Open Data Initiative. The data contains information about the intake and discharge of animals entering the Animal Welfare Center from the beginning of October 2013 to the present day.
The AWC wants to make use of this data to help uncover useful insights that have the potential to save these animals' lives. To make better decisions in the future regarding animal safety, AWC wants you to analyze this data and predict the status of the animals when they leave the welfare center.
